    4. Save the `static_store.js` file

9.  **Push the modified code**

    1. Make sure you have saved the `.env`, `manifest.yml`, and `static_store.js` files
    2. In the CLI, login to IBM Cloud by running the command: `ibmcloud login`
    3. If prompted to select an account, select the account on which you created the Node.js Cloud Foundry App
    4. Target the Organization and Space in which you created your Node.js Cloud Foundry App
        - `ibmcloud target -o {organization} -s {space}`
    5. From within this directory, run `ibmcloud app push {your-app-name}`, substituting `{your-app-name}` for the name of your app
        - e.g. `ibmcloud app push lem-assistant-chatbot`

10. **The chatbot app is now being deployed.**

    - **Once the deploy script has finished running**, you can test that you have followed these instructions correctly by navigating to your app's route which you copied in [Step 8.iii](#step_8iii). You should see a blank page with a blue button in the bottom right that says 'Need Help?'. Click on this button to open the chat dialog and test out the Watson Assistant service.  

        <img src="./public/screenshots/gif-1.gif" alt="Image gif-1" width="600px"/>  

11. **Add `<script>` tag into the target application within which the chatbot will exist**

    1. Open the HTML file of the page into which the script tag will be inserted. This will be the page where the blue button and dialog window will be displayed  
    2. Copy the following `<script>` tag and paste it below the end-tag of the `<body>` element:
        ```javascript
            <script data-main='chat_bot_app' src="{host}/chat_bot_app.js"></script>
        ```
    3. Change `{host}` in the `src` attribute to match your app's route which you copied in [Step 8.iii](#step_8iii)  
        
        ***NOTE: Make sure there is only one slash between your app's route and `chat_bot_app.js`***  
        
        <img src="./public/screenshots/11-a.png" alt="Image 11-a" width="700px"/>  
    4. Save your changes and either run your app locally or deploy it to your cloud environment

**Within your own application or website, a blue 'Need Help?' button should be visible in the bottom-right corner of the page into which the script tag was inserted. When the button is clicked, a chat window should appear and you should be able to have a conversation with your Watson Assistant service. <a href="https://lem-assistant-demo-1.mybluemix.net/">Here is a working demo.</a>**

## Codebase Information

### System Requirements
- [Installation of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Installation of NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node#terminals-editors-and-git-for-beginners)
- Browser: Up-to-date version of [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5veBRBBEiwAFTqDwTggc345A8KxyUcNEmc1evvkxhRQDSb8WS-FLmDQUPOyqJZL-LCsrRoCVMQQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&dclid=CP7z2LWAjt4CFaO6swod1zsEsw)

### Developer Knowledge
In order to understand the inner-workings of this application and modify any code/configurations, it is recommended that a developer have a basic understanding of the following languages/technologies/frameworks:
- [JavaScript: ECMAScript 2015](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
- [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [REST APIs](https://www.restapitutorial.com/)

Non-essential:
- [Atomic CSS](https://css-tricks.com/lets-define-exactly-atomic-css/)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/**docs**/en/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/)

### Data Flow
- To initiate the Chat bot, a user clicks the blue "Need Help?" talk bubble positioned at the bottom right of the page
- The user is greeted with a message from the Watson Assistant service
- The user then enters a question/phrase into the text area and presses enter
- The user's input is then sent to the Watson Assistant service associated with the app via the Node.js backend API
- The Watson Assistant service then finds the most relevant node within the service instance and sends a response to the Node.js back-end API
- The Node.js back-end API then sends the response to the front-end where it is put into a message and appended to the chat dialog

### Front-end (React.js)

Directories/Files:
- `/public/*`
- `/src/*`

The `/public/` directory contains:
- `bundle.js`: the compiled file that Webpack produces. ***Do not modify this file***
- `chat_bot_app.js`: a plain JavaScript file that contains an event listener which adds two scripts to the header of the document and a single wrapping `<div>` to the page which the chatbot is then loaded into.
- `chat_bot_styles.css`: CSS styling
- `favicon.ico`: the favicon
- `headerIcon.png`: the chat window header icon
- `index.html`: a sample page to add the `<script data-main="chat_bot_app" src="./chat_bot_app.js"></script>` script to. This holds the place of the actual page that the script would be added to and is only for demo purposes.

The `/src/` directory contains:
- `/components/`: all React components that make up the chat bot UI
- `index.js`: the entry point for the React app

### Back-end (Node.js/Express.js)

Directories/Files:
- `/app.js`: main file that configures the Node app: defines the routes, makes any public files available, and makes some libraries/packages available to the rest of the app through `module.exports`
- `/bin/www`: builds the HTTP server, binds it t a specific port and listens for requests
- `/routes/*`: contains an `/api` directory where all of the API routes are defined

### Configs & Other

Directories/Files:
- `.babelrc`: Babel configuration
- `.cfignore`: Cloud Foundry ignore file
- `.env`: Environment variable storage
- `.gitignore`: Contains file names that Git will ignore
- `manifest.yml`: Manifest file for Cloud Foundry deployment
- `static_store.js`: Static value storage file
- `webpack.config.js`: Webpack config file

### Libraries / Packages
All libraries/packages can be found in the `package.json` file. To add or remove a package to the app, use NPM and the corresponding NPM command for the specific package (e.g. `npm install [package]` or `npm uninstall [package]`). Do not delete or modify the `package-lock.json` file. The `/node_modules` directory is where all package code is stored and there's rarely a need to examine or modify `/node_modules` as long as one correctly adheres to NPM protocol.
